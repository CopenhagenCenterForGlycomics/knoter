The Knoter package has been designed so that for the normal occasional use case, the
package requires no extra configuration. However, if you are a power user, and want to
non-interactively authorise and upload to OneNote, you can set up an application configuration
with Microsoft to achieve this.

## Online access

A default client identifier is used, and requires re-authorisation every hour.

## Offline access

- Client Secret `ONENOTE_CONSUMER_SECRET`
- Client ID `ONENOTE_CLIENT_ID`
- DNS alias for localhost `HTTR_SERVER`
